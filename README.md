# Machine Learning and Data Science Repository

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees, along with data science methods like data imputation and normalization.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main components:

- **Algorithms:**
  - `knn`: Implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
  - `decision_trees`: Implementation of Decision Trees.

- **Data Science Methods:**
  - `data_imputation`: Notebooks and code related to data imputation techniques.
  - `normalization`: Notebooks and code demonstrating data normalization methods.

## Usage

Each subfolder contains Jupyter Notebooks (`*.ipynb`) that provide detailed explanations and examples of the respective algorithms or methods. Additionally, a PDF document is included for each task, containing related articles and insights.

Feel free to explore the folders, run the notebooks, and leverage the code for your own projects or learning purposes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
